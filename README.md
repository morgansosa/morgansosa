Hello! My name is Morgan, and I'm currently learning data analytics, data science, and machine learning. 

In my free time I enjoy reading, drawing, hiking, and learning Japanese.  I am especially interested in streamlining the language learning process. 

I plan to use GitHub as a way to upload projects I've been working on, and later a place to connect and collaborate with others. 
You can contact me at morgansosa@gmail.com!
