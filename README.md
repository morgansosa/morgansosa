## About Me
Hello! I'm Morgan Sosa, a researcher and developer with a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Oregon and a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and Chemistry from the University of Washington. My research focused on modeling the evolving mixture of H- and J-aggregates during organic film formation, providing insights into the structural and electronic properties of organic semiconducting molecules for optoelectronic applications.

I developed a computationally efficient method to model absorption spectra of organic molecular aggregates, facilitating real-time analysis during thin film formation. This method significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional approaches, aiding in the rational design of organic semiconductors.

Currently, I am expanding my skill set in data science and software development. My academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I am now applying to new challenges in these fields. I am particularly interested in projects that bridge my expertise in scientific research with modern data science and software development techniques.

This GitHub repository documents my learning journey, featuring projects and lessons in data science and software development. I aim to create a comprehensive portfolio that demonstrates my abilities and integrates my scientific background with new technical proficiencies.
